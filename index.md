365 Days of Coding in 2017
==========================

It's valuable to set goals that you can measure successfully, and what's easier than spending an hour to code once a day? While we all have busy lives and unexpected events, I find it worthwhile to give it a shot!

Some areas of coding I wish to improve

	* getting comfortable with web dev and all the new ways to make data science usable
	* specifically thinking about D3, but general web design and web services will be useful
	* standard OOP design patterns (see Head First)
	* functional programming paradigms, especially applied to R and Python
	* need tons more experience migrating data science skills to Python
	* really interested in exploring the Microsoft R capabilities with R Services
	* need to get real experience using distributed and cloud computing in general
	* but specifically I want to be a wiz at Spark and using it in the cloud
	* and I'd like to be comfortable whipping together a Hadoop MR job in Java


Beyond these or doing specific machine learning applications (e.g., recommender systems), I'm not really sure where I'll go in 2017. Regardless, getting 365 days of coding will help build out my portfolio and find areas I can polish or concentrate on for when I get into consulting. I've always been a "doer" but most of my experience outside of work has been academic. While fruitful in its own right, I need that real experience. I think this 2017 goal will help me get there! At least I hope others can find this daily log valuable, too.

Cheers!
