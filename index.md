# Sacramento Data Science and Machine Learning

Welcome to my [Coding](http://www.github.com/bryangoodrich) blog!

My goal with this blog is to cover 3 things. 
- Tackle quick data science coding challenges, because we all need mental exercise!
- Work on larger machine learning projects that can spur insights and innovation.
- Possibly build a minimal viable product (MVP) that can turn into career gold.
