# 365 Days of Coding in 2017


It's valuable to set goals, and what better way to measure success than having 365 days of code examples showing your progress? Hopefully, this exercise will prove useful to others, too! 

***
Some areas of coding I wish to improve

* Web development, particularly for data science, using or serving up D3 visuals and API.
* Standard OOP design patterns (see Head First).
* Functional programming paradigms, especially applied to R and Python.
* Everything Python. I've lived R for 10 years, it's about time I get as fluid with Python.
* Interested in what Microsoft R Services can improve.
* Need real experience using distributed and cloud computing in general; expect Hadoop examples!
* Along those lines, I need to get comfortable with Spark and SparkML
* Further, I'd like to be comfortable whipping together a Hadoop MR job in Java

Cheers!
