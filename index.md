# Let's Code!

Going into 2017, I'm hitting the ground running. Everyday I will commit 30-60 minutes to coding for data science, covering whatever topics come to mind (usually my RSS feeds or Twitter). 

Areas of special interest

* Web development (API, D3, Node, Bootstrap)
* Standard OOP design patterns (see Head First)
* Functional programming paradigms, especially applied to R and Python
* Py, Py, Python! Used R over a decade. Time to get fluid with Python
* Microft. I'm impressed with their data science direction + R Services and Azure
* Distributed technology (Hadoop, AWS, Azure blobstore)
* Along those lines: Spark, Spark, oh and SparkML!
