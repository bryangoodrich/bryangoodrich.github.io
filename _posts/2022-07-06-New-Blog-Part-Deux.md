It has been 5 years since I last updated this blog. I maintained the initial content in the [Daily Challenges](2017-01-01-Daily-Challenges.md) post, which demonstrates some key exercises that I found useful as reference material.

In any case, welcome! My career shifted from data science and machine learning toward data engineer in the interim. I was one of those data scientists not having the opportunity to truly grow as a data scientist; when you spend more time in Excel and PowerPoint than R, you know you need a change!

Since many of my struggles at work were data munging, I moved to IT and became a data engineer specializing in data warehousing, "big data" (Hadoop), distributed computation (Spark), and lately cloud architectures (Azure). 

I do have plans to eventually return to my machine learning roots and focus on ML engineering, but there is so much I have left to learn! I hope this blog is entertaining and educational. Leave me some feedback and suggestions. I appreciate the support and direction from the community.

Cheers
