It has been 5 years since I last updated this blog. I maintained the initial content, which also maintained its previous cotent. So maybe this is part the third? 

In any case, welcome! My career has shifted from data science and machine learning toward data engineer. I was one of those data scientists not having the opportunity to truly grow as a data scientists. When you spend more time in Excel and PowerPoint than R, you know you need a change! 

Since many of my challenges were data munging, I moved to IT and became a data engineer specializing in data warehousing, "big data" (Hadoop), distributed computation (Spark), and lately cloud architectures (Azure). 

I do have plans to eventually return to my machine learning roots and focus on ML engineering, but there is so much I have left to learn! I hope this blog is entertaining and educational. Leave me some feedback and suggestions. I appreciate the support and direction from the community.

Cheers
