A Sacramentian for over 3 decades, I have a passion for seeing this community thrive. I've grown up studying a myriad of things--from personal training and cooking to philosophy and economics. My main passion always comes back to problem solving. This day and age, that means coding and statistics. The foundations of data science. Looking for work in this area, I have noticed the skill gap in the Sacramento region. Many assume the proximity to Silicon Valley will simply bring talent to the area through some sort of osmosis, but I haven't seen it happen. Instead, I've watched a slow churning culture of hackers, hipsters, hobbyists, and government employees thirst for what the Bay Area represents. With big data technologies becoming more accessible, cheaper, and user-friendly, I think the time is ripe to see the Sacramento region blossom with new talents and new solutions to age old problems. I hope I can contribute to that in some way, and share that journey with you all here.
