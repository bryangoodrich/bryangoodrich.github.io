# About Me

I have lived among spreadsheets, and walked among data scientists. I have bested bad data, and saved broken imports. As a data engineer, my passion is architecting solutions that empower developers to solve many problems: abstract, automate, and APIs. 

This blog is my space to share my experiences and best practices that I have learned work within my sphere of influence. 


### Topics to Expect

* Automation
* Functional Patterns
* Domain-Driven Design
* Microservices and SOA
* Data Science & ML Integration
